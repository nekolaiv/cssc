## Updating Your Fork from the Upstream Repository

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to update your forked repository with the latest changes from the original (upstream) repository.

### Prerequisites

- You have a forked repository on GitHub.
- You have Git installed on your local machine.
- You have cloned your forked repository to your local machine.

### Steps to Update Your Fork

1. Open Your Terminal

Navigate to your local repository using the terminal:

```bash
cd path/to/your/local/repo
```

2. Add Upstream Remote: Do this once only

If you haven't already added the upstream repository as a remote, run the following command:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nekolaiv/cssc
```

`<URL-of-upstream-repo>` should be the URL of the main repository. You can find this URL on the original repo's GitHub page.

3. Fetch the Changes from Upstream

To retrieve the latest changes from the upstream repository, execute:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

4. Merge Changes into Your Local Branch

Switch to your main branch (usually `main` or `master`):

```bash
git checkout main  # or master
```

Now, merge the upstream changes:

```bash
git merge upstream/main  # or upstream/master
```

5. Resolve Conflicts (if any)

If there are any conflicts, Git will indicate which files are conflicting. Open those files and manually resolve the conflicts. Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<`, `======`, `>>>>>>`) and edit the code as needed.

After resolving conflicts, mark the files as resolved:

```bash
git add <specific-file-with-conflict> # or git add .
```

Then, complete the merge:

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

6. Push Updates to Your Fork

Finally, push the updated changes to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main  # or master
```

## Collaborations

All contributions must be made from branches other than the `main` branch. This ensures that the main codebase remains stable while we review contributions.
